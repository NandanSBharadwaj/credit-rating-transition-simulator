This project presents a structured framework for credit risk analysis using a historical credit rating transition matrix, based on standards consistent with agencies such as S&P. The model employs a Markov chain approach to simulate the migration of credit ratings over a multi-year horizon, capturing the probabilistic evolution of corporate bond creditworthiness. Transition data is rigorously preprocessed, normalized, and validated to ensure the integrity of simulation inputs and compliance with financial modeling standards.
In addition to rating migration, the model incorporates a bond valuation mechanism that maps credit ratings to representative market values. This enables the tracking of expected bond performance across thousands of simulated paths, offering a statistical view of credit deterioration and capital erosion over time. Visualization modules support the interpretation of results, including rating distribution histograms and average bond value curves, which are critical for communicating risk exposure to stakeholders.
The framework also supports recession scenario analysis by adjusting downgrade and default probabilities to reflect adverse macroeconomic conditions. Expected losses are computed under both baseline and stressed environments using a configurable Loss Given Default (LGD). This functionality allows for practical portfolio stress testing and enhances the modelâ€™s applicability in risk assessment, capital planning, and regulatory reporting contexts.
